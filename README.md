# my-take-on-youtube-thumbnail-averaging
this is a variation of @emnersonn (on youtube)'s idea. basically it averages out the thumbnails of a youtube channels' video's then shows you the averaged image. my version has a gui that can help you with the proccess. but make sure you dont run it in a bad area because it will create two folders one for images and the other for the final averaged image. 1. (script location)/(creator name)/(name of video).(extension). 2. (script location)/(creator name)- average/image.png.
i have now updated it to you class based averaging. So make sure image_averager.py and main.py are in the same directory. as of now there are 5 averaging methods. mean averaging, median averaging, min averaging, max averaging, standard deviation averaging, and finally var averaging. i added a new program average_directory.py this is to make it so if you have already download the thumbnails (or any other images). you can simply tell it the locate directory and it will let you scroll through the screenshots and go through averages
